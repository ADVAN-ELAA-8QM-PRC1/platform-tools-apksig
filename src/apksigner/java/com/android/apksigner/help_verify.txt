USAGE: apksigner verify [options] apk

This checks whether the provided APK will verify on Android.

By default, the check is performed for all known Android platforms. Thus,
verification will fail for an APK which is signed using stronger algorithms or
schemes which are not available on older platforms. For best results use
--min-sdk-version to limit the range of platform versions for which the
verification if performed. For example, by default, it is best to set
--min-sdk-version to the APK's minSdkVersion.


        OPTIONS

--min-sdk-version     Lowest API Level on which this APK's signatures will be
                      verified. By default, 1 is used. The suggested strategy is
                      to set this value to the corresponding value from the
                      APK's AndroidManifest.xml.

--max-sdk-version     Highest API Level on which this APK's signatures will be
                      verified. By default, the highest possible value is used.

--print-certs         Show information about the APK's signing certificates

-v, --verbose         Verbose output mode

-h, --help            Show help about this command and exit

-Werr                 Treat warnings as errors


        EXAMPLES

1. Check whether the APK's signatures will verify on API Level 15 and newer
   Android platforms:

$ apksigner verify --min-sdk-version 15 app.apk
